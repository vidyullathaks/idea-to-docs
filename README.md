# **IdeaForge — AI PRD Generator**  
Transform raw product ideas into structured, professional‑grade Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) with user stories and acceptance criteria.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**IdeaForge** is an AI‑powered tool that converts rough product concepts into complete, structured PRDs. It’s designed for product managers, founders, students, and teams who want to accelerate early‑stage product definition without sacrificing clarity or structure.

Users simply describe their idea, and IdeaForge generates:

- Problem Statement  
- Target Audience  
- Goals & Objectives  
- Key Features  
- Success Metrics  
- Out of Scope  
- Assumptions  
- User Stories with Acceptance Criteria  

The tool is fully deployed and accessible online.

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists  
Writing PRDs is time‑consuming, especially in the early ideation phase. IdeaForge helps users:

- Move from idea → structured document in seconds  
- Explore multiple product directions quickly  
- Improve clarity before involving engineering  
- Learn how strong PRDs are structured  
- Build confidence in product thinking  

This project demonstrates practical AI product management, prompt engineering, and full‑stack deployment.

## 🧩 How It Works  
1. User enters a product idea.  
2. Frontend sends the idea to the backend via API.  
3. Backend injects the idea into a structured PRD prompt.  
4. LLM generates a complete PRD.  
5. Frontend displays the PRD with clean formatting.  
6. User can generate multiple PRDs and switch between them.
